## OTP 27.0-rc1

Erlang/OTP 27.0-rc1 is the first release candidate of three before the OTP 27.0 release.

The intention with this release is to get feedback from our users. All feedback is welcome, even if it is only to say that it works for you.
We encourage users to try it out and give us feedback either by creating an issue here https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues or by posting to [Erlangforums](https://erlangforums.com/).

All artifacts for the release can be downloaded from the [Erlang/OTP Github](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-27.0-rc1) release and you can view the new documentation at https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-15.0-rc1/doc/.
